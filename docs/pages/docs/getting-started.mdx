# Getting Started [Get started with nautilus in just a few lines of code]

## Overview
nautilus addresses many common pain points faced by developers interacting with the data economy by offering a range of features enhancing productivity and efficiency.
You will find a quick introduction on this page to get you setup with the **Data Economy TypeScript Toolkit**.

## Installation

:::code-group

  ```bash [npm]
  npm i @deltadao/nautilus
  ```

  ```bash [pnpm]
  pnpm i @deltadao/nautilus
  ```

  ```bash [bun]
  bun i @deltadao/nautilus
  ```

## Quick Start
### 1. Setup your Signer
Firstly, create the signer you want to use with your nautilus instance. nautilus uses the ethers.js `Signer`. You can read more about possible configurations in the [official documentation](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/signer/).

```ts twoslash
import { Wallet, providers } from 'ethers'
import { Nautilus } from '@deltadao/nautilus'

const provider = new providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.dev.pontus-x.eu') // [!code focus]
const signer = new Wallet('0x...', provider) // [!code focus]
```

In this example we create an ethers `Wallet` from a given private key and connect to a RPC provider of our choice.

### 2. Setup the nautilus instance
Now that you have a Signer set up, you can use it to bootstrap your nautilus client instance.

``` ts twoslash
import { Wallet, providers } from 'ethers'
import { Nautilus } from '@deltadao/nautilus'

const provider = new providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.dev.pontus-x.eu')
const signer = new Wallet('0x...', provider)

const nautilus = await Nautilus.create(signer) // [!code focus]
```

Note, that we use the previously created Wallet and pass it to Nautilus to create the instance with this signer.

### 3. Interact with the data economy
With the client instance bootstrapped you can now trigger any transactions or access calls supported by OceanProtocol.

``` ts twoslash
import { Wallet, providers } from 'ethers'
import { Nautilus } from '@deltadao/nautilus'

const provider = new providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.dev.pontus-x.eu')
const signer = new Wallet('0x...', provider)

const nautilus = await Nautilus.create(signer)

const accessUrl = await nautilus.access({ assetDid: 'did:op:12345'}) // [!code focus]
const data = await fetch(accessUrl) // [!code focus]
```

In this example we construct a one-time `accessUrl` and can then use it to fetch the data associated with the respective data service.
