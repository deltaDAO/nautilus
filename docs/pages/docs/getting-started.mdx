# Getting Started [Get started with viem in just a few lines of code.]

## Overview
viem is a TypeScript interface for Ethereum that provides low-level stateless primitives for interacting with Ethereum. viem is focused on developer experience, stability, bundle size, and performance:

Developer experience Automatic type safety and inference, comprehensive documentation, composable APIs.
Stability Test suite runs against forked Ethereum networks, complete test coverage.
Bundle size Tree-shakable lightweight modules.
Performance Optimized encoding/parsing, async tasks only when necessary.
You can learn more about the rationale behind the project in the Why viem section.

## Quick Start
### 1. Setup your Signer
Firstly, create the signer you want to use with your nautilus instance. nautilus uses the ethers.js `Signer`. You can read more about possible configurations in the [official documentation](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/signer/).

```ts twoslash
import { Wallet, providers } from 'ethers'
import { Nautilus } from '@deltadao/nautilus'

const provider = new providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.dev.pontus-x.eu') // [!code focus]
const signer = new Wallet('0x...', provider) // [!code focus]
```

In this example we create an ethers `Wallet` from a given private key and connect to a RPC provider of our choice.

### 2. Setup the nautilus instance
Now that you have a Signer set up, you can use it to bootstrap your nautilus client instance.

``` ts twoslash
import { Wallet, providers } from 'ethers'
import { Nautilus } from '@deltadao/nautilus'

const provider = new providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.dev.pontus-x.eu')
const signer = new Wallet('0x...', provider)

const nautilus = await Nautilus.create(signer) // [!code focus]
```

Note, that we use the previously created Wallet and pass it to Nautilus to create the instance with this signer.

### 3. Interact with the data economy
With the client instance bootstrapped you can now trigger any transactions or access calls supported by OceanProtocol.

``` ts twoslash
import { Wallet, providers } from 'ethers'
import { Nautilus } from '@deltadao/nautilus'

const provider = new providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://rpc.dev.pontus-x.eu')
const signer = new Wallet('0x...', provider)

const nautilus = await Nautilus.create(signer)

const accessUrl = await nautilus.access({ assetDid: 'did:op:12345'}) // [!code focus]
const data = await fetch(accessUrl) // [!code focus]
```

In this example we construct a one-time `accessUrl` and can then use it to fetch the data associated with the respective data service.
