# Publishing [Entering the world of a decentralized data economy]

Without publishing data, applications and services a data economy could not exist.
This process usually is about describing your asset in a standardized way, so that it can be displayed by catalogues or even be offered on marketplaces and sold to others.

Constructing a so called [DDO (a DID document)](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/developers/ddo-specification) can be challenging and time consuming, especially if you are just starting out.
nautilus aims to significantly streamline this process by exposing two main builder classes that provide typed APIs to help you with this process.

The `AssetBuilder` is the main class responsible for constructing the asset metadata and the `ServiceBuilder` class uses the same pattern allowing to configure the services used within the asset's metadata.


## AssetBuilder
Creating the builder is easy:

```ts twoslash
import { AssetBuilder } from '@deltadao/nautilus'

const assetBuilder = new AssetBuilder() // [!code focus]
```

With this we can now continue to setup the metadata information for the asset:

```ts twoslash
import { AssetBuilder } from '@deltadao/nautilus'

const assetBuilder = new AssetBuilder()

assetBuilder // [!code focus]
  .setType('dataset') // [!code focus]
  .setName('My New Asset') // [!code focus]
  .setDescription('This is a publish asset building test using Nautilus') // [!code focus]
  .setAuthor('Company Ltd.') // [!code focus]
```

The last step is to simply `build()` the asset. This will return a correctly configured asset, ready to be published.

```ts twoslash
import { AssetBuilder } from '@deltadao/nautilus'

const assetBuilder = new AssetBuilder()

assetBuilder
  .setType('dataset')
  .setName('My New Asset')
  .setDescription('This is a publish asset building test using Nautilus')
  .setAuthor('Company Ltd.')

const asset = assetBuilder.build() // [!code focus]
```

Note, that if required, there is a lot more that can be customized. To learn more about the API head over to the detailed [`AssetBuilder` documentation](/docs/api/AssetBuilder).

## ServiceBuilder

Now, the asset above has some nice metadata setup, but we will not be able to really interact with it, unless we define the services it should expose.

This is where the `ServiceBuilder` class comes in handy to specify the necessary information, such as the method used to access our data or application we want to publish.

We start by setting up the `ServiceBuilder` we want to use:

```ts twoslash
import { UrlFile, FileTypes, ServiceTypes, ServiceBuilder } from '@deltadao/nautilus'

const serviceBuilder = new ServiceBuilder({ // [!code focus]
    serviceType: ServiceTypes.ACCESS, // [!code focus]
    fileType: FileTypes.URL // [!code focus]
}) // [!code focus]
```
> **_NOTE:_** There are multiple supported [ServiceTypes](/docs/api/ServiceBuilder#servicetypes) and [FileTypes](/docs/api/ServiceBuilder#filetypes)

Next, we declare the "file" we want to publish. This can follow multiple protocols, here we'll use a HTTP GET request:
```ts twoslash
import { UrlFile, FileTypes, ServiceTypes, ServiceBuilder } from '@deltadao/nautilus'

const serviceBuilder = new ServiceBuilder({
    serviceType: ServiceTypes.ACCESS,
    fileType: FileTypes.URL
})

const urlFile = {  // [!code focus]
  type: 'url',  // [!code focus]
  url: 'https://link.to/my/asset',  // [!code focus]
  method: 'GET'  // [!code focus]
}  // [!code focus]
```

Finally, we add the required metadata and the file we created utilizing the builder pattern to then build the service:
```ts twoslash
import { UrlFile, FileTypes, ServiceTypes, ServiceBuilder } from '@deltadao/nautilus'

const serviceBuilder = new ServiceBuilder({
    serviceType: ServiceTypes.ACCESS,
    fileType: FileTypes.URL
})

const urlFile = { 
  type: 'url', 
  url: 'https://link.to/my/asset', 
  method: 'GET' 
} satisfies UrlFile

const service = serviceBuilder // [!code focus]
    .setServiceEndpoint('https://provider.dev.pontus-x.eu') // [!code focus]
    .setTimeout(0) // [!code focus]
    .addFile(urlFile) // [!code focus]
    .setPricing({ // [!code focus]
        type: 'free' // [!code focus]
    }) // [!code focus]
    .build() // [!code focus]
```

> **_NOTE:_** The serviceEndpoint specified should point to the provider instance you want to be able to access your published data. [Learn more](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/developers/provider).

## Publishing the Asset

Bringing everything together, in the last step we will now anchor the asset on a network of your choice using the publish function provided by nautilus:

```ts twoslash
import { Nautilus, AssetBuilder, FileTypes, ServiceBuilder, ServiceTypes } from '@deltadao/nautilus'
import { Wallet } from 'ethers'

const signer = new Wallet('')
const nautilus = await Nautilus.create(signer)

const assetBuilder = new AssetBuilder()
const service = new ServiceBuilder({ serviceType: ServiceTypes.ACCESS, fileType: FileTypes.URL}).build()

// ---cut---
const asset = assetBuilder.addService(service).build() // [!code focus]
const result = await nautilus.publish(asset) // [!code focus]
```
