# Why Nautilus [A brief introduction on why you want to use Nautilus]

## Common Pain Points
As a developer working within [OceanProtocol](https://oceanprotocol.com) ecosystems, you're likely familiar with the complexities of data publishing, consumption, and computation.

From configuring metadata and defining pricing schemes to managing access controls, these tasks can often be time-consuming and error-prone, detracting from your focus on building innovative applications.

This is exactly why we built **nautilus**: a developer-focused TypeScript library designed to simplify and streamline your development experience within any OceanProtocol ecosystem.

## Features
nautilus addresses these common pain points faced by developers, offering a range of features to enhance productivity and efficiency.

### Builder Pattern
nautilus leverages a [Builder Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) to simplify and streamline the configuration process for data economy assets and services. By encapsulating the construction of complex metadata objects into separate builder classes, nautilus provides a clear and intuitive interface for developers to specify the desired configurations.

This approach offers several benefits to end-users, including improved readability, maintainability, and flexibility. With the Builder Pattern, developers can easily chain together method calls to set various properties of assets and services, making the configuration process more declarative and less error-prone. 

### Feature complete
Whether you want to manage data assets or their respective services, utilizing publish and edit functionalities, want to access and download data that has been published in a specific dataset or leverage OceanProtocol's Compute-to-Data capabilities: nautilus aims to enable every single step necessary in a streamlined manner.

For example, you can easily start compute jobs, monitor their progress, and retrieve results seamlessly â€” all from within your development environment.
